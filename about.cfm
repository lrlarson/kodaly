    <p>Holy Names University’s American Folk Song Collection is a unique resource for music teachers, parents, choral conductors and composers. On this site you can:</p>

<li>Learn more about HNU’s Kodály Center and folk song collection (<a href="the-kodaly-center.cfm">The Kodály Center</a>) </li>
<li>Locate folk song resources (<a href="bibliography.cfm">Bibliography</a>) </li>
<li>Look up unfamiliar terms (<a href="glossary.cfm">Glossary</a>) </li>
</ul>

<p>The online collection was created by HNU faculty members, Anne Laskey and Gail Needleman, from HNU’s collection of American Folk Songs for Teaching, developed over 35 years by faculty and students at HNU’s Kodály Center. In 2000, we received an award from the Gerald E. and Corinne L. Parsons Fund for Ethnography at the Library of Congress (LOC) to research historical field recordings in the LOC Archive of Folk Culture. These recordings, transcribed and analyzed, form the heart of the online, multimedia version of the collection, created by noted arts website producer Larry Larson and consultant John Sullivan, which was launched in 2004 with the support of the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation. It quickly became the premier site for American folk music.</p>

<p>The collection contains folk songs representing most of the geographic and cultural populations of the United States. Each song has been selected for its beauty, suitability for teaching and musical versatility. All songs in the collection include lyrics, a musical score and song analysis showing how it can be used to develop children’s musical and cultural understanding. </p>

<p>In 2013, we received a second grant from the Hewlett Foundation to expand and enhance the site. The new site, launched in 2014, is available on mobile devices and includes expanded search capabilities, additional songs and recordings, historical and cultural information about the songs, and a curriculum guide for teachers. </p>

<p>New songs are added to the collection on a regular basis, providing an ongoing resource for teachers, parents, and all those interested in introducing young people to the rich tradition of American folk music.</p>
